## Receiving a Book Gift

I received a Christmas book gift from Hong-seok, the team leader at Depromeet. He said it was a book he had read before and thought I would enjoy it too. There are many reasons why I'm glad I applied to Depromeet, but the biggest reason is meeting wonderful people like this. Thanks to him, I opened a non-development book for the first time in a while at the end of the year.

## Overview

The protagonist John embarks on a journey to free himself from work and daily routine. However, due to an unexpected accident that blocks the road, he finds himself stranded and takes a different route than planned. Since this was an unplanned path, he gets lost and discovers a lit cafe (The Cafe at the End of the World) just as his fuel is nearly depleted. Hungry from wandering around, John orders food. But the menu at The Cafe at the End of the World contains three questions alongside the food items.

1. Why are you here?
2. Do you fear death?
3. Are you fulfilled?

John, who entered the cafe to satisfy his hunger, unexpectedly encounters these three questions and learns about their meaning and necessity through conversations with Casey the waitress, Anne a fellow customer, and Mike the chef. This transforms his perspective on the world.

## The Story of the Green Sea Turtle on the Waves

The Cafe at the End of the World teaches that we must know what we truly want right now. Most people either work hard hoping to receive rewards later or continue their current work out of habit. However, we need to find what we want to do and desire in the present, which connects to the question "Why are you here?"

Is it really necessary to know what we currently want? Casey answers this doubt with a sea turtle story. While we think turtles are slow, they're actually very fast and impossible to catch if you try to chase them. But there's a secret to sea turtle movement: they wait for and use the waves they want to ride. If a wave comes that goes against their desired direction, sea turtles wait for their preferred wave while recovering their strength.

We encounter various unexpected events in daily life, and if we struggle with all our might in everything, we might lack energy when we truly need it. However, if we know what we really want, like sea turtles, we can recover our strength during unwanted tasks and pour our energy into what we truly desire.

## Why We Do Things We Don't Want

Sometimes we might be mistaken about what we want. Anne, a fellow customer, talks about advertising. According to Anne, all kinds of advertisements in the world portray that purchasing products will bring meaning or happiness to life. Moreover, these messages imply that life lacks happiness and meaning without buying these products.

Anne says she wanted to buy such products and spent her time earning money for them. However, when she actually purchased these items, happiness and meaning didn't come to her life. Anne attributes this vicious cycle (advertising -> work -> product purchase -> little satisfaction) to being mistaken about what she truly wanted. To prevent such vicious cycles, we need to clearly know what we currently want.

## Do You Fear Death?

The sudden appearance of the word "death" might seem awkward. If we clearly know what we currently want and live a life practicing it, does that mean death won't be scary? Not exactly, but if death comes while we're sacrificing the present for the future, wouldn't we just be leaving after a life of sacrifice? If we're doing what we truly want in the present, even if we die, we won't regret the way we lived, and since we were living our best life, we'll have fewer regrets and less disappointment about sudden death.

This content felt similar to Steve Jobs' Stanford commencement speech, where he mentioned looking in the mirror every morning and asking, "Would I do this work if I were to die tomorrow?" and changing direction when the answer was "No."

## Are You Fulfilled?

Regardless of what we learned growing up, what advertisements we encountered, what work we did, or what stress we experienced, ultimately, we are the ones who create our lives. Even if we clearly know what we want to do and desire in the present, if we don't practice it ourselves, it's no different from not knowing at all. Ultimately, the last question asks whether we're making our lives fulfilling by sufficiently doing what we want - the reason for our existence in the world.

## Beautiful Things That Would Exist Without Me

Surrounded by all kinds of affairs and stress, the world seems like a place full of stress. However, while I think the world is full of stress, someone else might feel the world is a fulfilling place. Moreover, there must be a world that I can feel is fulfilling. So if the world I see is a negative space, it might not be bad to search for the fulfilling world that exists somewhere.

## My Thoughts

"The Cafe at the End of the World" has a strong didactic nature. It persuades readers why they should answer the three questions and explains what changes when they find their own answers. It felt like receiving life consulting while reading the book.

The author probably wanted readers to ask themselves these three questions while reading and find their own answers. However, while reading, I found myself thinking more about why Hong-seok liked this book and why he recommended it to me.

The Hong-seok I know is passionate and methodical, and I particularly remember how he clearly knows what he currently wants and expresses it clearly. I suspect this book might have influenced that aspect of Hong-seok.

I also want to use this book as an opportunity to examine more carefully what I currently want. As the book mentions, I don't think these are questions that can be answered in a short time. However, I think even occasionally recalling these questions and checking whether I'm living my life well could be of great help.
