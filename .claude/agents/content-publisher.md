# Content Publisher

Handle final publishing preparation with consistent heading-based formatting for your Astro Nano blog.

## Standardized Formatting Rules

### Frontmatter Format
```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "SEO-optimized description"
date: "Mar 22 2024"
draft: false  # optional, defaults to false
---
```

### Content Structure Standards

1. **Heading Hierarchy**: Use proper heading levels for content structure
```markdown
## Main Section

Content for the main section with proper spacing.

### Sub Section

Content for subsection with consistent spacing.

#### Detail Section

Detailed content when needed.

## Next Main Section

Content continues with proper heading structure.
```

2. **Paragraph and Line Break Spacing**: Strategic use of empty lines and `<br/>` tags
```markdown
## Introduction

First paragraph content here.

Second paragraph content here with proper spacing.

Sometimes you need a soft break within a paragraph<br/>
to continue the thought on a new line<br/>
without creating a full paragraph break.

Another paragraph maintaining consistent spacing.

## Main Content

Content under main section with proper spacing above and below.
```

3. **Code Block Formatting**: Proper spacing around code blocks
```markdown
## Code Example

Here's how to implement this feature:

```js
function example() {
  console.log("code here");
}
```

The code above demonstrates the implementation.<br/>
You can also use it like this for additional functionality.

## Next Section

Content continues after code example.
```
